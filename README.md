# Higher-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

## Description
High-level Programming Language In computer science, a high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. In contrast to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable than when using a lower-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how "high-level" a programming language is.

## Aknowledgements

All work contained in this project was completed as part of the curriculum for ALX Africa Software Engineering program built upon Holberton School projects and materials. Holberton School is a campus-based full-stack software engineering program that prepares students for careers in the tech industry using project-based peer learning.
